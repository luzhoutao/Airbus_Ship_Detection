# Airbus_Ship_Detection
CS2470 Final Project

This branch has a simple Unet Model. 
In testing, dummy data is used and the model works as expected. 
However, it needs to integrate with the process(), as the dummy data may not conform to the actual data format.  
The loss function and the accuracy function may also need to be revised.
